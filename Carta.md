What is ASC 820?

ASC 820 is an accounting standard that provides a framework for defining, measuring, and reporting the fair value of investments. By standardizing how fair value is measured and disclosed, ASC 820 ensures financial statements provide stakeholders, investors, regulators, and decision-makers with reliable details about a company’s assets, financial liabilities, and equity. ASC 820 is part of the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s (FASB) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) guidance, and is used broadly where fair value is required or permitted.

ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, known as the exit price.

The way fair value is calculated can vary by investment type, including:

    Market-based: Fair value is determined by the market perspective, not the reporting entity.

    Exit price: Fair value is measured at the price an asset can be sold, separating it from the entry price, transaction price, or initial acquisition cost.

    Principle market: Fair value assumes transactions occur in the market with the greatest volume or activity for the asset. Or, in its absence, the most advantageous market, which maximizes value for the entity.

ASC 820 fair value hierarchy

ASC 820 categorizes assets into a three-level fair value hierarchy based on their liquidity. The more liquid an asset, the easier it is to determine its value.
Level 1: Direct market prices

    Definition: Uses quoted prices from active markets for identical assets.

    Example: Publicly traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or exchange-traded funds (ETF).

Level 2: Observable market data

    Definition: Uses pricing inputs other than direct quotes from active markets. These inputs are observable, including quoted prices for similar items or derived values from market data.

    Example: Interest rate swaps valued on yield curves, and commodity swaps priced using forward market data.

Level 3: Unobservable inputs

    Definition: Based on pricing inputs not readily observable in the market. These involve internal methodologies relying on management’s best estimate of fair value.

    Example: Preferred stock in a private company.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) released guidance around how best to value a Level 3 asset in mid-2019. Though the AICPA generally provides guidance in line with GAAP, the ASC 820 guidance was written to be in line with both GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).
ASC 820 disclosure requirements

ASC 820’s disclosure requirements report the valuation techniques and inputs used for fair value measurements in financial reporting. Key disclosure requirements include:

    Fair value measurement by level: Entities must categorize assets and liabilities into Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, the amounts within each level, and any transfers between levels.

    Valuation techniques: Entities must disclose the valuation approach (market, income, or cost approach) used for Level 2 and Level 3 measurements and the inputs applied, like discount rates, yield curves, or price multiples.

    Level 3 measurement details: Entities must provide detailed quantitative disclosures about unobservable inputs used in the valuation, and a description of the process for developing unobservable inputs.

    Fair value measurement changes: Entities must disclose changes in fair value measurements over the reporting period.

    Nonrecurring fair value measurements: For assets measured on a nonrecurring basis, entities must disclose the reasons for the measurements, the fair value hierarchy level, and the valuation techniques used.

    Impact of market conditions: Entities must disclose the effect of market conditions, like volatility or illiquidity, on fair value measurements.

ASC 820 valuation methodology

A company’s enterprise value is an estimate of its total worth, taking into account its equity value, debt, and cash balance. There are three valuation methods that can be relied on to calculate enterprise value:
Income approach

Also known as a discounted cash flow or capitalized cash flow analysis, the income approach estimates the cash flow a company is expected to generate in the future. The income approach may be best for late-stage companies that are generating positive cash flow or nearing profitability.
Market approach

Market approach methods rely on observable market indications to arrive at the enterprise value of the portfolio company:

    The guideline public company (GPC) method uses a list of reasonably comparable public companies (in terms of size, revenue model, and target audience) and examines the implied multiples of relevant financial metrics to arrive at an enterprise value of the portfolio company.

    The guideline transaction method looks at recent mergers and acquisitions of reasonably comparable target companies and examines the implied multiples of relevant financial metrics to arrive at an enterprise value of the portfolio company.

    The backsolve or post-money valuation method relies on the portfolio company’s most recent equity financing round to determine the value of the portfolio company.

    A market approach may be best for companies that cannot accurately predict long-term future performance or those that have not completed a round of financing within the last 12 months.

Asset approach

The asset approach determines the value of a portfolio company based on the value of the company’s net assets. This approach may be appropriate for very early-stage companies with a simple capitalization structure.
Allocation methods

The second step in determining the fair value of an investment is to allocate the subject company’s enterprise value across each of its share classes. This can be done using four potential allocation methods:
Waterfall

The waterfall method accounts for the rights and liquidation preferences of the equity holders. It may be a good option if the company has a complex cap table and there is visibility into a near-term acquisition.

Option pricing model (OPM)

The OPM considers the rights and preferences of the shareholders, as well as the anticipated exit timeline and market volatility when considering a continuous distribution of outcomes. The OPM could be a great option for early-stage companies with less visibility into the timing or form of a future exit.
Common stock equivalent (CSE)

The CSE moves away from the consideration of rights and preferences, instead allocating value to equity holders assuming all preferred shares have converted to common shares. This allocation method is typically used in conjunction with the post-money method or when a company is nearing an IPO.
Probability weighted expected return method (PWERM)

PWERM focuses on distinct future outcomes, including likely future exit dates and anticipated exit values, then assigns weighting to each of those outcomes and allocates that value to each share class.

ASC 820 valuations: Methodologies

Choosing accurate and appropriate methodologies for an 820 valuation is dependent on the specifics of each company and each fund’s valuation policy. Factors that influence methodology selection include a company's funding history, historical and projected financials, timing to a liquidity event, and other factors. The following are common methodologies accepted by the AICPA Practice Aid:

    Post-money method: This methodology takes the price paid in the most recent financing multiplied by the number of common stock equivalents.

    Subject company transaction or “Backsolve” method: This methodology consists of examining the values of prior equity transactions of the portfolio company.

    Guideline public company method: This methodology relies on an analysis of publicly traded companies similar in industry and/or business model to the portfolio company. This methodology uses guideline companies to develop relevant market multiples using metrics such as revenue, and/or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). These multiples and values are then applied to your company’s corresponding financial metrics.

    Guideline company transaction method: This methodology relies on an analysis of transactions of companies similar in industry and/or business model to the portfolio company. This methodology uses guideline companies to develop relevant market multiples using metrics such as revenue, and/or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). These multiples and values are then applied to your company’s corresponding financial metrics.

    Income approach: The income approach focuses on the income producing capability of your company, and is commonly known as a discounted cash flow analysis. Carta’s valuation tool does not currently have this capability.

Understanding ASC 820 fair value

Before we dive into the ASC 820 fair value hierarchy and different methods for calculating fair value under ASC 820, it probably makes sense to clarify what we mean by “fair value.” In this context, fair value refers to the price that will be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability. ASC 820 also specifies that the exchange must be an orderly transaction between market participants, and it must take place on the specified measurement date. The price under these conditions is also known as the exit price.
What is the fair value hierarchy?

ASC 820 creates a three-level hierarchy of financial assets and financial liabilities for the purpose of classification. Generally speaking, this hierarchy breaks down along lines of liquidity. The more liquid an asset, the higher-up its place in the hierarchy. The most liquid assets are classified as Level 1, while the least liquid assets are classified as Level 3.

How a financial instrument is categorized within the fair value hierarchy aligns with the lowest level that’s significant to the fair value measurement. In other words, Level 1 inputs are the highest priority and should be used when possible.
Level 1 (most liquid)

Among all classified assets and liabilities, these are the most liquid. This generally means that, on the date of measurement, there are quote market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. For example, public exchange-traded shares would likely be classified as Level 1 because the price of a share is quoted in an active market.
Level 2 (less liquid)

Level 2 assets and liabilities are less liquid than Level 1 and more liquid than Level 3. While it may be difficult to find quoted prices for an identical asset or liability in active markets, it might be possible to find prices for something similar. (Or, one might look in markets that aren’t active for a reference point). One may need to observe inputs other than quoted prices to arrive at a valuation for a Level 2 asset or liability. Examples may include credit or interest rate swaps.
Level 3 (highly illiquid)

Level 3 assets and liabilities are trickier, because they’re typically no market data nor other observable inputs you can use to assess their value with any degree of accuracy. In general, the inputs for these valuations reflect management's best estimates and assumptions of how market participants would price the assets or liabilities on the date of measurement. Examples may include certain foreign stocks, complex derivative products, or private equity shares in an early-stage startup whose valuation is based at least partly on unobservable inputs.
Steps to measure fair value using ASC 820

So far we’ve defined a lot of terms and provided a lot of context, but the question remains: how does one actually use ASC 820 to measure fair value? There are, generally speaking, two primary steps for doing so:
1. Calculate the company’s enterprise value

The first step in the process is to determine the enterprise value of the company. This enterprise-level calculation can then be used to determine how the value is allocated across share classes.

There are three different valuation techniques you can use to arrive at a calculation of the overall value of the company, and which approach you choose may depend on a number of factors. Let’s take a look:

    The income approach (a.k.a. capitalized cash flow analysis). This approach is generally best for businesses already generating a cash flow, because it involves estimating the present value of cash flows expected to be generated in the future.
    The market approach. As its name suggests, this approach involves an evaluation of observable general market conditions to arrive at a company’s enterprise value. For example, you might look at publicly traded companies of comparable size, revenue, and target market/audience (this sub-approach is called the guidelines public company method and involves a number of assumptions). Other variations of the market approach involve looking at recent M&A deals for comparable companies, or using figures from the company’s most recent financing round to arrive at a reasonably accurate valuation.
    The asset approach. This approach essentially locates the value of the company in the total value of its assets. Simple enough, which is why earlier-stage startups without much cash-flow or comparable-company data to reference may opt for this method.

2. Allocate the resulting value across all of the company’s share classes

The next and final step in this process is to take the enterprise value you arrived at in Step 1 and allocate it across all of the company’s share classes. As in the previous step, you have some different methods for how to do this.

    The waterfall method. Among the more complex (and artfully named) methods of the bunch, the waterfall method allocates value based on rights and preferences of every stakeholder in the company’s cap table. A waterfall approach could make the most sense if the company is nearing an acquisition or IPO.
    The option pricing model (OPM). This method essentially treats each share class as a call option on the overall equity value of the company. It may use a model such as the Black-Scholes model to account for factors such as market volatility and time to liquidity.
    The probability-weighted expected return method (PWERM). It’s not the most elegant acronym, but PWERM can be another method to consider for companies expecting a short period of time between the date of the valuation and a potential future liquidity event. This is because PWERM is concerned with evaluating a range of specific future outcomes, and as such it requires you to make some more specific assumptions about what those outcomes might be. PWERM factors in and weighs those outcomes based on their probability of actually happening, then allocates the value to each share class based on the rights and terms of different shareholder agreements.
    The common stock equivalent. This method first assumes that preferred shares of stock are converted into common shares, then allocates a value for all shares. Unlike the methods discussed above, it doesn’t account for the various rights and preferences some shareholders may be entitled to.
